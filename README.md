Baseline Eco-evolutionary Model For Soil-Transmitted Helminths

This repository is for numerically solving and analyzing a baseline model for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of anthelmintic resistance in soil-transmitted helminths.  It is associated with a manuscript for publication; in particular, it includes code for generating figures in the manuscript.

The main code is written to run in R.  One additional file runs in Mathematica.  Note that this piece is not necessary and a pdf of the Mathematica notebook is also provided.
