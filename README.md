Baseline Eco-evolutionary Model For Soil=Transmitted Helminths

This repository is for numerically solving and analyzing a baseline model for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of anthelmintic resistance in soil-transmitted helminths.  It is associated with a manuscript for publication; in particular, it includes code for generating figures in the manuscript.
